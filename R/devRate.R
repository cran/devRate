#'
#' @section Overview:
#'
#' The devRate package provides three categories of functions:
#'
#' - to find development rate information about a specific organism (Order, Family, Genus, species): which equations were used and what are the associated parameters (e.g., helpful to estimate starting values for your empirical data sets);
#'
#' - to relate development rate and temperature; and
#'
#' - to plot your empirical datasets and the associated fitted model, and/or to plot development curves from the literature.
#'
#' @section Usage:
#'
#' You can use the package:
#'
#' - to get development rate curves as a function of temperature for a specific organism (hundred of examples from the literature are included in the package);
#'
#' - to know which equations exists and which are most used in the literature; and
#'
#' - to relate development rate with temperature from your empirical data, using the equations from the package database.

#'
#' @section Documentation:
#'
#' The package includes two vignettes (long-form documentation):
#'
