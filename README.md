## devRate package

### Purpose of the package
The devRate package allows quantifying the relationship between development rate and temperature in ectotherm organisms. 

### How to use the package
You can use the package: 
- to get development rate curves as a function of temperature for a specific organism (hundred of examples from the literature are included in the package);
- to know which equations exists and which are most used in the literature; and
- to relate development rate with temperature from your empirical data, using the equations from the package database.

### Installation instructions
install.packages("devRate")

### Overview
The devRate package provides three categories of functions:
- to find development rate information about a specific organism (Order, Family, Genus, species)
- to relate development rate and temperature; and
- to plot your empirical datasets and the associated fitted model, and/or to plot development curves from the literature.
