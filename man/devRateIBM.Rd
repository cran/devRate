\title{Forecast ectotherm phenology as a function of temperature and developmental rate models}
\usage{
devRateIBM(tempTS, timeStepTS, models, numInd = 100, stocha,
  timeLayEggs = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{tempTS}{The temperature time series (a vector).}

\item{timeStepTS}{The time step of the temperature time series (a numeric).}

\item{models}{The models for developmental rate (a list with objects of class nls).}

\item{numInd}{The number of individuals for the simulation (an integer).}

\item{stocha}{The standard deviation of a Normal distribution centered on
develomental rate to create stochasticity among individuals (a numeric).}

\item{timeLayEggs}{The delay between emergence of adults and the time where
females lay eggs in time steps (a numeric).}
}
\value{
A list with three elements: the table of phenology for each individual,
   the models used (nls objects), and the time series for temperature.
