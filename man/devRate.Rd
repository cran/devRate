\title{devRate: A package to quantify the relationship between development rate and temperature in ectotherms.}
\description{
The devRate package allows quantifying the relationship between development rate and temperature in ectotherm organisms.
}
\details{
### How to use the package

You can use the package:

- to get development rate curves as a function of temperature for a specific organism (hundred of examples from the literature are included in the package);

- to know which equations exists and which are most used in the literature; and

- to relate development rate with temperature from your empirical data, using the equations from the package database.

### Installation instructions

install.packages("devRate")

### Overview

The devRate package provides three categories of functions:

- to find development rate information about a specific organism (Order, Family, Genus, species): which equations were used and which are the associated parameters (e.g., helpful to estimate starting values for your empirical data sets);

- to relate development rate and temperature; and

- to plot your empirical datasets and the associated fitted model, and/or to plot development curves from the literature.
